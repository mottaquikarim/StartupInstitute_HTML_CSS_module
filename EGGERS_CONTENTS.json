Here's the quick **cliffnotes** on my life:\n\n#### Origin Story\nMoved to **America** when I was **5 years old**. Learned english from watching the Smurfs.\n\n#### Life as a kid\nGrew up in **Astoria, Queens**. Scraped my knees a lot.\n\n#### Claim to Fame\n**Naz** dropped out of my **middle school**, I.S. 204Q.\n\n#### #Humblebrag\nExtremely lucky to count myself as an alumnus of **Stuyvesant High School** and **The Cooper Union**. \n\n#### Goal in Life\nMotto of my life: **See a Need, Fill a Need** (Bigweld, *Robots*).\n\n#### What I want to be when I grow up\nBecome an **author**; write fictional stories and memoirs about life as an immigrant, clever mental math tricks, and the art of pick-up streetball.\n\n#### What I actually do now that I have grown up\nOne night per week, I don't sleep and instead build or improve on an **classroom tools** that help me **teach more efficiently** or help my **students learn more effectively**.\n\n\n#### Normalizing Our Backgrounds\n---\n\nLet's spend a few minutes doing a quick background check on everyone's knowledge of HTML basics.\n\nWe can use this as a way to see how comfortable everyone is with the initial content and if needed, fill in any gaps in understanding as required.\n\n","idx":3},"key-deliverable":{"content":"# Key Deliverable\n---\n\nIn order to explore the core concepts of this class and achieve our learning objectives, we will recreate the **traditional resume template** for the web.\n\n#### Key Requirements\n---\n\n* Template should resemble the typical resume.pdf we all maintain\n* Template should use tasteful CSS3 styles to accentuate key peices of information and design principles\n* Template should work across all screens including (and specifically) mobile\n* Template should be **printer friendly** and take up exactly one page  when printed. \n\nHere is an **[example](http://resume.taqquikarim.com/)**.\n\n#### Task\n---\nPlease create a simple webpage and mark up your own resume template. Use **only** pure **HTML tags** and do not worry to much about the styles itself. You may use the **[example](http://resume.taqquikarim.com/)** above as reference.\n\nIf you do not feel comfortable using your own credentials in this exercise, feel free to make up a persona or use a celebrity (ie: **Mickey Mouse**).\n","idx":4},"semantic-html":{"content":"# Semantic HTML\n---\n\nHTML5 introduces a plethora of new tags. These tags are mainly used to dictate structure and meaning to the **information** that is presented on our website.\n\n### EXERCISES\n---\nHere are the main problems that we will be working towards in this section of the class.\n#### Problem 1:\n---\n\nTake the resume that you built for homework and redefine the content using the **semantic** html elements we will be learning about today.\n\nIf you did not do the homework or just wish to use something else, feel free to use my **[resume](http://resume.taqquikarim.com)**.\n\n\n\n#### Properly marking up your page\n---\nDon't worry about what the `id` attributes mean for now.\n\n![site structure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/L4qMt.png)\n\n#### Sections VS Articles\n---\nUse **sections** when you are outlining **chapters in a book**. \n\n**EXAMPLE**: A dessert cookbook could have chapters on **cake** recipes vs **pie** recipes.\n\nUse **articles** when you are defining say **poems** in a volume.\n\n**EXAMPLE**: In our dessert cookbook, **each recipe** in the **cake** section would be an **article**.\n\nYou can nest **articles** into **sections** and **sections** into **articles**.\n\n**EXAMPLE**\n\nArticles can go inside section tags\n```html\n<section>\n    <article>\n      <!-- first blog post -->\n    </article>\n    \n    <!-- .... more articles here ... -->\n</section>\n```\n\nSections can also go inside article tags\n```html\n<article>\n  <section>\n     <!-- introduction -->\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n     <!-- content -->\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n     <!-- summary, etc -->\n  </section>\n</article>\n```\n\n**THIS STUFF IS PARTLY SUBJECTIVE; THERE REALLY IS NO ONE RIGHT ANSWER**. As long as we are consistent and don't violate the laws of HTML (ie: we don't put a **p** tag inside a **a** tag, or something like that). \n\n#### Headers, Footers, Nav, Main\n---\n\n* Use headers/foorters/navs as **often as you'd like** within each section/article/aside\n* Each sectioning element (section/article/aside) can have it's own `h1` tag (some validators say this is not recommended but this is still technically allowed)\n* I usually put `nav` tags inside the `header` or `footer` pages\n* **MAIN** can only be used once per page. Typically, it is used to define what the main content block of the page is. Don't have to use it though. \n* Essentially, **the blue in the previous image could be wrapped in a main tag**\n\n\n#### Semantic HTML5 Tags\n---\n\nHere are some of the main tags that are supported.\n\n**SECTION**: Represents a generic document or application section.\n\n**HEADER**: Represents a group of introductory or navigational aids..\n\n**FOOTER**: Represents a footer for a section and can contain information about the author, copyright information, et cetera.\n\n**NAV**: Represents a section of the document intended for navigation.\n\n**MAIN**: Defines the main content of a document.\n\n**ARTICLE**: Represents an independent piece of content of a document, such as a blog entry or newspaper article\n\n**ASIDE**: Represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page.\n\n#### More info on sections vs articles\n---\n\n**SECTION**: Used to either group different articles into different purposes or subjects, or to define the different sections of a single article.\n\n**ARTICLE**: `<article>` is related to `<section>`, but is distinctly different. Whereas `<section>` is for grouping distinct sections of content or functionality, `<article>` is for containing related individual standalone pieces of content, such as individual blog posts, videos, images or news items. \n\n\n\n\n","idx":5},"practical-css3-guidelines":{"content":"# Practical CSS3 Guidelines\n---\n\nLet's talk about **CSS**, or **Cascading Style Sheets**, the language that allows us to define styles and adjustments to default content on our webpages.\n\n### EXERCISES\n---\nHere are the main problems that we will be working towards in this section of the class.\n#### Problem 1:\n---\n\nTake the resume that you built in the last section and apply a few of the CSS principles we will cover in this section to improve overall user experience.\n\n### Basic Definition\n---\n\nMethod for searching your html tags efficiently and styling the results it finds.\n\n** Three ways to CSS **\n\n1.

Desktop First\n---\nThese two schemas are techniques for how we structure our css.\n\n**Most important takeaway**: almost always go with mobile first.\n\n \n* Remember, CSS is cascading which means that we can write one set of styles and then reapply other styles on top of that.\n\n#### Mobile First\n\nWith mobile first, we create the mobile layout first, then add a media query for tablet (with tablet styles) and then add a media query for desktop (with desktop styles)\n\n#### Desktop First\n\nWith desktop first, we create the desktop layout first (so styles for desktop), then add a media query for tablet, then mobile.\n\n#### Mobile First > Desktop First\n**Here's why**:\nforces you to think about the stuff that's really necessary for simplest version of your page and implement those\n\n\n* With mobile first, you simply add styles as needed as width increases (vs removing styles the other way around, which leads to writing more code)\n\n#### Examples\n---\nHere are some examples of different media queries.\n\n* #### [Basic Example; Mobile first](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4080)\n\n* #### [Basic; Desktop first](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4081)\n\n* #### [AND-ing](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4082)\n\n* #### [OR-ing](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4083)\n\n* #### [Buckets](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4084)\n\n* #### [Overriding](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4085)\n\n#### Common Breakpoints\n---\n**NOTE**: you should **NEVER** design for device specificity.

Build our own simple HTML page\n2. Push it to GitHub.\n\n## Building a basic HTML page\n---\nAt this point, we know that the server from our last section (say, **Google's** server) will return to us a response that is encoded in a specific way (a **language** if you will).\n\nBut! **Where is this data stored?**\n\nAs it turns out, it is stored in files and folders, in the same way we store data on our computers.\n\nSo in order for us to \"build\" our own HTML page, we must do two things:\n\n1. Create a folder to store our HTML data\n2. Create a file **within that folder** and write out HTML.\n\n## Pushing to GitHub\n---\n\nOk, now we have an HTML page! And get this: we can even load it in Chrome and see it rendered! How do we get this online?\n\nIn one word: **GitHub**.\n\n#### What is GitHub anyways?\n---\n\nGitHub is a service that allows developers to **push** their local **git repositories** online. As a courtesy, they also have their own server that will **host** HTML/CSS/JavaScript files that are found in the pushed repos.\n\nBut first, a few definitions:\n\n#### Git\n---\nGit is an open source software that allows developers to collaborate on large software projects. \n\nWith Git, developers can **commit** code at certain checkpoints. So for example, if you are building a website that requires:\n\n1. a form,\n2. a slideshow,\n3. and a server request, \n\nYou would implement the form then **commit** that code. Then, you would implement the slideshow and **commit**. Finally, you would implement the server requestand **commit** once more. \n\nThis is useful because if, for any reason your updates to the slideshow breaks your form code, you can easily **roll back** to your last commit (the form implementation) and that code would remain pristine and unbroken. \n\n#### Git Repository \n---\nWhen you take a piece of code and start tracking it with Git, you are turning it into a git **repository**. Your git repository will store all your commits, keep track of your code, give you commands that allow you to roll back to a previous commit, etc.\n\n#### Pushing to GitHub\n---\n\nThe final piece is this: your awesome git repo has let's say 500 commits on it. This is awesome! \n\nBut now calamity strikes! Your computer inexplicably dies the morning of your big presentation. Here's the main question: **are you screwed?**\n\nIn one word: **Yes**. \n\nIncidentally, this is **exactly** the problem GitHUb solves. As it turns out, Git allows you to **push** your git repos to other places. Either your friends computer, or your spare home computer, etc. GitHub is basically a cloud storage system that lets you store your git repos online for **free** and also share it with other developers.","idx":8},"frontend-frameworks":{"content":"# Frontend Frameworks\n---\n\n**Learning Objective**: What are front-end frameworks and how do they allow us to create modern, professional looking websites?\n\n#### Exercise\n---\n\nRe-imagine your resume webpage with one of the frameworks below. Without making too many changes, add some of the prebuilt UI elements that these frameworks offer. \n\n**Challenge**: How would you overwrite some of the styles of these frameworks? Say for example you'd like to add a button with **background-color** pink. How would you do this?\n\n---\n\nFrameworks are basically CSS stylesheets that were developed by other people.
