Here's the quick **cliffnotes** on my life:\n\n#### Origin Story\nMoved to **America** when I was **5 years old**. Learned english from watching the Smurfs.\n\n#### Life as a kid\nGrew up in **Astoria, Queens**. Scraped my knees a lot.\n\n#### Claim to Fame\n**Naz** dropped out of my **middle school**, I.S. 204Q.\n\n#### #Humblebrag\nExtremely lucky to count myself as an alumnus of **Stuyvesant High School** and **The Cooper Union**. \n\n#### Goal in Life\nMotto of my life: **See a Need, Fill a Need** (Bigweld, *Robots*).\n\n#### What I want to be when I grow up\nBecome an **author**; write fictional stories and memoirs about life as an immigrant, clever mental math tricks, and the art of pick-up streetball.\n\n#### What I actually do now that I have grown up\nOne night per week, I don't sleep and instead build or improve on an **classroom tools** that help me **teach more efficiently** or help my **students learn more effectively**.\n\n\n#### Normalizing Our Backgrounds\n---\n\nLet's spend a few minutes doing a quick background check on everyone's knowledge of HTML basics.\n\nWe can use this as a way to see how comfortable everyone is with the initial content and if needed, fill in any gaps in understanding as required.\n\n","idx":3},"key-deliverable":{"content":"# Key Deliverable\n---\n\nIn order to explore the core concepts of this class and achieve our learning objectives, we will recreate the **traditional resume template** for the web.\n\n#### Key Requirements\n---\n\n* Template should resemble the typical resume.pdf we all maintain\n* Template should use tasteful CSS3 styles to accentuate key peices of information and design principles\n* Template should work across all screens including (and specifically) mobile\n* Template should be **printer friendly** and take up exactly one page  when printed. \n\nHere is an **[example](http://resume.taqquikarim.com/)**.\n\n#### Task\n---\nPlease create a simple webpage and mark up your own resume template. Use **only** pure **HTML tags** and do not worry to much about the styles itself. You may use the **[example](http://resume.taqquikarim.com/)** above as reference.\n\nIf you do not feel comfortable using your own credentials in this exercise, feel free to make up a persona or use a celebrity (ie: **Mickey Mouse**).\n","idx":4},"semantic-html":{"content":"# Semantic HTML\n---\n\nHTML5 introduces a plethora of new tags. These tags are mainly used to dictate structure and meaning to the **information** that is presented on our website.\n\n### EXERCISES\n---\nHere are the main problems that we will be working towards in this section of the class.\n#### Problem 1:\n---\n\nTake the resume that you built for homework and redefine the content using the **semantic** html elements we will be learning about today.\n\nIf you did not do the homework or just wish to use something else, feel free to use my **[resume](http://resume.taqquikarim.com)**.\n\n\n\n#### Properly marking up your page\n---\nDon't worry about what the `id` attributes mean for now.\n\n![site structure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/L4qMt.png)\n\n#### Sections VS Articles\n---\nUse **sections** when you are outlining **chapters in a book**. \n\n**EXAMPLE**: A dessert cookbook could have chapters on **cake** recipes vs **pie** recipes.\n\nUse **articles** when you are defining say **poems** in a volume.\n\n**EXAMPLE**: In our dessert cookbook, **each recipe** in the **cake** section would be an **article**.\n\nYou can nest **articles** into **sections** and **sections** into **articles**.\n\n**EXAMPLE**\n\nArticles can go inside section tags\n```html\n<section>\n    <article>\n      <!-- first blog post -->\n    </article>\n    \n    <!-- .... more articles here ... -->\n</section>\n```\n\nSections can also go inside article tags\n```html\n<article>\n  <section>\n     <!-- introduction -->\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n     <!-- content -->\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n     <!-- summary, etc -->\n  </section>\n</article>\n```\n\n**THIS STUFF IS PARTLY SUBJECTIVE; THERE REALLY IS NO ONE RIGHT ANSWER**. As long as we are consistent and don't violate the laws of HTML (ie: we don't put a **p** tag inside a **a** tag, or something like that). \n\n#### Headers, Footers, Nav, Main\n---\n\n* Use headers/foorters/navs as **often as you'd like** within each section/article/aside\n* Each sectioning element (section/article/aside) can have it's own `h1` tag (some validators say this is not recommended but this is still technically allowed)\n* I usually put `nav` tags inside the `header` or `footer` pages\n* **MAIN** can only be used once per page. Typically, it is used to define what the main content block of the page is. Don't have to use it though. \n* Essentially, **the blue in the previous image could be wrapped in a main tag**\n\n\n#### Semantic HTML5 Tags\n---\n\nHere are some of the main tags that are supported.\n\n**SECTION**: Represents a generic document or application section.\n\n**HEADER**: Represents a group of introductory or navigational aids..\n\n**FOOTER**: Represents a footer for a section and can contain information about the author, copyright information, et cetera.\n\n**NAV**: Represents a section of the document intended for navigation.\n\n**MAIN**: Defines the main content of a document.\n\n**ARTICLE**: Represents an independent piece of content of a document, such as a blog entry or newspaper article\n\n**ASIDE**: Represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page.\n\n#### More info on sections vs articles\n---\n\n**SECTION**: Used to either group different articles into different purposes or subjects, or to define the different sections of a single article.\n\n**ARTICLE**: `<article>` is related to `<section>`, but is distinctly different. Whereas `<section>` is for grouping distinct sections of content or functionality, `<article>` is for containing related individual standalone pieces of content, such as individual blog posts, videos, images or news items. \n\n\n\n\n","idx":5},"practical-css3-guidelines":{"content":"# Practical CSS3 Guidelines\n---\n\nLet's talk about **CSS**, or **Cascading Style Sheets**, the language that allows us to define styles and adjustments to default content on our webpages.\n\n**Basic Definition**\n\nMethod for searching your html tags efficiently and styling the results it finds.\n\n** Three ways to CSS **\n\n1. This way is evil, we won't even talk about it.\n2. This way is also not very good, we won't even talk about it.\n3. This way is ideal! let's discuss how to link in external files to your index.html...\n\n** Selectors **\n\n**SELECTOR**: a keyword used to query your html tags, classes, ids -- (the last two are html attributes)\n\n**RULES**: the style attributes you are going to set\n\n**[Exhaustive list of CSS properties and values](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/)**\n\n#### CSS Use Cases\n---\n\nHere are some interesting use cases where CSS3 in particular becomes super handy.\n\n#### Animations\n---\n\nYou can do some really awesome work with animating your elements.\n\n* **[Spinner](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/42730)**\n\n* **[Repeating, multiple animations](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4270)**\n\n#### Transitions\n---\n\nTransitions are animations that are triggered usually by some form of user interaction.\n\n* **[Hover Effects](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4268)**\n\n#### Pseudo Selectors\n---\n\nPsuedo classes allow us to style specific types of element features, **i.e.** the **:hover** pseudo selector can be used to style an element as the user puts his mouse over it.\n\n* **[Menu Hover Effect](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4957)**\n\nOther examples of pseudo selectors: **:visited**, **:after**, etc\n\n#### Overflows\n---\n\nKeep track of content and determine how it should behave if there is more content than space in the container.\n\n* **[Overflow Example](http://fewd.us/howdoi/#/problem/4165)**\n\n#### Grids\n---\n\nThis one is super expansive and you could literally teach an entire course on this.
